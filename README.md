# FP-PDV: Customized version of PDV for FragPipe.

FP-PDV is a customized version of PDV for FragPipe. I changed the GUI layout, optimized the database structure, and implemented new functions fitting FragPipe results especially.

## Installation

The FP-PDV packages are free to download at [https://github.com/Nesvilab/FP-PDV/releases](https://github.com/Nesvilab/FP-PDV/releases).

### Run in FragPipe (Recommended)

The FP-PDV has already been released together with FragPipe. However, the latest version of FP-PDV can be downloaded here and updated manually in FragPipe.

(1) Open the `tools` in your FragPipe folder.
