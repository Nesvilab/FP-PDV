# FragPipe-PDV: Customized version of PDV for FragPipe.

FragPipe-PDV is a customized version of PDV for FragPipe. I changed the GUI layout, optimized the database structure, and implemented new functions fitting FragPipe results especially.

## Installation

The FragPipe-PDV packages are free to download at [https://github.com/Nesvilab/FragPipe-PDV/releases](https://github.com/Nesvilab/FragPipe-PDV/releases).
